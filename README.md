# Chatbot
The Ava Chatbot Project is an interactive chatbot using Python (Flask) for backend, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend, and JSON for its knowledge base. It processes user inputs, matches keywords, and returns dynamic responses on topics like cricketers and places, offering an engaging, local, and extensible solution.
